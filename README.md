🚀 Advanced Computer Programming (CT 153)

📍 Year: I – Part II  
💻 Language: Python

🎯 Course Overview  
This course teaches Python from the ground up, starting with programming paradigms and progressing through core syntax, object-oriented programming, error and file handling, and finally diving into powerful libraries like NumPy for real-world problem solving.

By the end of the course, you’ll be able to:  
✅ Write Python code using both procedural and OOP styles  
✅ Handle files, errors, and exceptions gracefully  
✅ Work with advanced data structures  
✅ Use NumPy for mathematical, statistical, and linear algebra operations  

📑 Syllabus Breakdown  
1. Programming Paradigms  
   - Types, pros/cons, examples  

2. Introduction to Python  
   - History, features, comparisons (C/C++/Java/JS)  
   - Popular implementations  

3. Python Basics  
   - Data types, variables, inputs  
   - Operators, conditionals, loops  
   - Functions & recursion  

4. Advanced Data Types  
   - Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, 2D lists  
   - Mutable vs immutable  
   - Lambda functions  

5. Object-Oriented Programming  
   - Classes, objects, methods  
   - __init__(), __str__(), deleting, iterators  
   - Inheritance (single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical)  
   - Polymorphism, abstract classes  
   - Operator overloading (arithmetic, bitwise, comparison, assignment, unary)  

6. Exceptions & File Handling  
   - Errors & exceptions  
   - Try/except handling  
   - User-defined exceptions  
   - assert and logging  
   - File handling (text, binary, random access)  

7. Python Libraries & Math (NumPy)  
   - Modules, packages, frameworks  
   - NumPy arrays: creation, indexing, slicing, editing  
   - Stacking, reshaping, concatenation  
   - Arithmetic operations & broadcasting  
   - Random number generation  
   - Statistics & linear algebra with NumPy  

🛠 Tools Required
