🚀 Advanced Computer Programming (CT 153)

📍 Year: I – Part II
💻 Language: Python

🎯 What this course is about

This course is all about learning Python the right way – starting from programming paradigms, moving into Python basics, OOP concepts, error handling, file handling, and finally exploring libraries like NumPy for real problem solving.

By the end, you’ll be able to:

Code in Python (procedural + OOP)

Handle files, errors, and exceptions smoothly

Work with advanced data structures

Use NumPy for math, stats, and linear algebra

📑 Syllabus Overview
1. Programming Paradigms

Types, pros/cons, examples

2. Intro to Python

Why Python, history, features, comparison with C/C++/Java/JS

Popular implementations

3. Basics

Data types, variables, inputs

Operators, conditionals, loops

Functions & recursion

4. Advanced Data Types

Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, 2D lists

Mutable vs immutable

Lambda functions

5. Object-Oriented Programming

Classes, objects, methods

__init__(), __str__(), deleting, iterators

Inheritance (single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical)

Polymorphism, abstract classes

Operator overloading (arithmetic, bitwise, comparison, assignment, unary)

6. Exceptions & File Handling

Errors & exceptions

Try/except handling

User-defined exceptions

assert and logging

File handling (text, binary, random access)

7. Python Libraries & Maths (NumPy)

Modules, packages, frameworks

NumPy arrays: creation, indexing, slicing, editing

Stacking, reshaping, concatenation

Arithmetic ops & broadcasting

Random number generation

Statistics & linear algebra with NumPy

🛠 Tools You’ll Need
